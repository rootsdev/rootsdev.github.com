One developer suggested that we needed a community, another suggested we needed standards, another suggested we needed to rally behind an open-source project, and yet another just wanted a place to discuss development practices in the family history domain.\r\n\r\nEventually we created RootsDev, modeled on the successful community of library programmers at [#code4lib](http://code4lib.org/).","google":"UA-39459437-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
